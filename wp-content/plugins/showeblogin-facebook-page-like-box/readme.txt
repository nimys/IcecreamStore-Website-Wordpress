== Shortcode ==
Users had requested to make available shortcode to use this plugin. Accordingly, I have made it possible to show your facebook page likebox anywhere in your website through shortcode.

<strong>Default Shortcode: </strong>
Use this default shortcode to show facebook likebox in posts, pages and any other place.
>[swt-fb-likebox]

<strong>Customized Shortcode: </strong>
Following shortcode can be used to display your own facebook page with customized features to control on its size, header cover, call to action button, showing faces and post feeds etc.
><strong>[swt-fb-likebox url="https://www.facebook.com/SuperWebTricks" width="340" height="500" small_header="false" show_faces="true" data_hide_cta="true" stream="false"]</strong>

Thus, after successfully activation of this plugin you may use the above shortcode to your posts as well as pages by just replacing the URL with your own facebook page address.
